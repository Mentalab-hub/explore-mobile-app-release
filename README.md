# Mentalab Explore Mobile App
The Mentalab Explore Mobile App is a cross-platform application designed to interface seamlessly with Mentalabâ€™s ExG devices, enabling users to record and visualize biosignals in real time. 
Developed with portability and accessibility in mind, the app supports both iOS and Android platforms, allowing researchers and professionals to connect to Mentalab ExG devices via latest Bluetooth technology(BLE). 
Users can monitor, manage, and export data from EEG, ECG, EMG, and other bioelectrical signals directly from their mobile devices, making it an ideal tool for applications in neurofeedback, clinical research, and mobile health monitoring.
